  The Offensive Security, Incident Response and Internet Security Laboratory (OSIRIS Lab) is a security research environment where students analyze and understand how attackers take advantage of real systems. This approach gives our students a unique perspective and a proper foundation that allows them to master any area of security at NYU Tandon.
