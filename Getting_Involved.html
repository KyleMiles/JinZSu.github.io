<h1>Cyber Security Club</h1>
<p>
	The Cyber Security Club is an open weekly seminar run by the OSIRIS lab.  Each week during the semester we have students, researchers, and industry professionals give informal lectures and presentations on a variety of topics related to security. All Cyber Security Club speakers are selected by invite only.

<h1>Hack Night</h1>
<p>Developed from the materials of NYU Tandonâ€™s old Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course, Hack Night is a sobering introduction to offensive security.  A lot of complex technical content is covered very quickly. Students are introduced to a wide variety of complex and immersive topics over thirteen weeks.
