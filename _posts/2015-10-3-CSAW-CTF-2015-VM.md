We’re given a .tar.xz which contains a partially corrupted git repo. Running ```git log``` reveals 4 commits, which all primarily build out one main .c file:

All done now! Should calculate the flag..assuming everything went okay.

There's only two factors. Don't let your calculator lie.

Initial commit! This one should be fun.

However if we run ```git fsck``` (as later put in as the problem’s hint), we notice that there are 3 corrupt blobs, corresponding to the 3 non-initial commits:

After zlib-decoding the first corrupted blob (354ebf3…), the string “51337” stands out as strange (the ‘5’ in particular). Assuming this challenge is feasible, we assume that there is only one or two characters in the blob that have been changed. After writing a quick python script which automatically tries substituting each ASCII printable character in a particular space, we run the script against this blob, assuming the character '5’ in '51337’ has been modified. The script successfully changes the 5 into a 3, and the hash is now valid.

This script was then run again on the second blob (d961f81…) after manually changing the 51337 into 31337, and the script successfully found a hash match by changing '270031727027’ into '272031727027’. After applying both of these changes to the final blob with an incorrect hash (f8d0839…), we noticed that the flag was not properly cout’d (the line was ```cout &lt;&lt; &amp;lag```). We assumed that the character flip in this blob was changing ‘f’ to ‘&amp;’ in ```cout &lt;&lt; flag```, and were correct. After extracting the code from the final blob, making the 3 changes, and compiling, getting the flag is as simple as following the directions of the program.

The final script is below:
