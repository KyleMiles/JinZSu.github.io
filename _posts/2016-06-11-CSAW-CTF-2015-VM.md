Last year, we had many ctf teams from around the world compete in the annual <a href="https://ctf.csaw.io">CSAW CTF</a>. This event is geared toward college undergradates, however it is open to anyone who wishes to play.

Weâ€™re releasing most of the CSAW CTF challenges in a VM for those who were not competing to download and try on their own.
