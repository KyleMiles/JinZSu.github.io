A few weeks ago, we ran the annual [CSAW CTF](https://ctf.csaw.io) finals round. We’ve released the problems so that anyone can play the problems themselves at home.

Check them out [here](https://github.com/isislab/CSAW-CTF-2016-Finals)

Thanks to everyone for playing and I hope you’re ready for CSAW next year.
